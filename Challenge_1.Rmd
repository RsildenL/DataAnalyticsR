```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(data.table)
```


```{r}
machine_data <- fread("Data/machine_data.csv")
product_data <- fread("Data/product_data.csv")

```


## Question 1: General overview of the data
### Machines
```{r}
number_of_machines <- uniqueN(machine_data$machine)

machine_dist <- machine_data[,.(.N), by=small_machine]
machine_dist[,percent := N/number_of_machines]

machine_dist_by_location <- machine_data[,.(.N),by = .(small_machine, location_type)]
machine_dist_by_location [,percent := N/number_of_machines]

number_of_machines; machine_dist; machine_dist_by_location
```

### Products 
```{r}

product_names <- unique(product_data$product_name)
number_of_products <- uniqueN(product_data$product_name)
number_of_products

product_dist <- product_data[,.(.N, mean_price = mean(price)), by=category]

number_of_products; product_dist
```

### Transactional data


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
